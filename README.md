# EdgeBundling

Useful edge bundling matlab code.

Part of a M/EEG functional connectivity visualization approach.
Exploratory data analysis requires analytical approaches and practical data visualization strategies and tools. The versatile abilities of the human visual system for pattern recognition and inference are also key in this context. It also has applications in communicating results in publications or presentations. In this chapter, a functional connectivity visualization pipeline is presented to address current limitations in M/EEG data analysis: it provides anatomically coherent fibre visualization, with bundling capacities in native brain space. The proposed method produces virtual-fibre tracing from an approximation of the white matter volume. The interactive manipulation of these high-dimensional datasets provides improved clarity in whole-brain connectivity analysis.
